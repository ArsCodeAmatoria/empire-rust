## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo
- OpenSSL (for TLS support)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArsCodeAmatoria/empire-rust.git
cd empire-rust

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file in the project root:

```toml
[server]
bind_address = "0.0.0.0:1337"
username = "admin"
password = "secure_password"
heartbeat_timeout = 30

[client]
server_address = "127.0.0.1:1337"
username = "agent"
password = "secure_password"
heartbeat_interval = 10
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
cargo run --bin server
```

### Connecting an Agent

```bash
cargo run --bin agent
```

### Using the Client

```bash
cargo run --bin client
```

## Security

- TLS encryption for all communications
- Secure authentication
- Command validation
- File integrity checks
- Heartbeat monitoring
- Connection timeouts
